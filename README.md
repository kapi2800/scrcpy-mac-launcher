# ScrcpyLauncher for macOS

A lightweight macOS GUI launcher for [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy), made with SwiftUI.

## Why?

I use scrcpy a lot, but on macOS there’s no simple UI app — only terminal. So I decided to build one!

## Features

- Launch scrcpy with one click
- Minimal SwiftUI interface
- Lightweight and fast

## Requirements

- macOS (tested on M4)
- [scrcpy for macOS](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/releases) downloaded
- Optional: Install via Homebrew

## How to Use

1. Download scrcpy from the official GitHub releases.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Open the Xcode project and run the app.
4. Make sure the app has permission to access the folder where `scrcpy` is stored.
5. Click the "Launch" button!

This is still a work-in-progress. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
